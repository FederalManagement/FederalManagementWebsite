					Federal Management have teamed up with Tracesure and are proud to offer an exclusive Track & Trace service available for tracing absconded or missing persons.
					</br></br>
					Tracesure provide a unique 'no trace - no fee' service that is used by thousands of entities across the UK, EU and even further afield to search for and locate individuals not wishing to be found or that have simply relocated without informing the relevant parties or even family members. Tracesure can track down the most elusive of people using their specialist resources and network of field contacts. Tracesure clients include Solicitors, Debt Collection Agencies, Government Authorities, Letting Agents and even Individuals!
					</br></br>
					Why pay for expensive private investigators or spurious trace agents who want fees even if they do not get a result? On a no trace - no fee basis, Tracesure can find your missing person within minutes and get the results to you fast and all for Â£50. You only pay once Tracesure have located the person in question and with this exclusive service, total discretion is assured.
